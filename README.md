# Utils.css

##What is this?

This is a collection of mixins for everyday CSS classes that are handy and important enough to be used as mixins. In accordance with DRY(Don't repeat yourself), i have decided not to write them again and save any mixin i create and also the good ones i come across.

In order to use in your LESS or SASS files, just do:

```css
@import 'utils';
```

Happy hacking!
